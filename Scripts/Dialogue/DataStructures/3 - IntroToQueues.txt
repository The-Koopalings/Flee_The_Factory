Explain Queues & how the inventory is green + has text as to what it is

CODE_BLOCK
Let's go over how Pickup and UseItem work for Queue mode

HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
Pickup in Queue mode works exactly the same as in Stack mode. 
HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
Pickup automatically places a picked-up item into the smallest, or leftmost, available index & if my inventory is full then I can't pickup the item.

HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
UseItem works differently in Queue mode because it follows the FIFO principle of Queues.
HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
UseItem will try to use the earliest picked up item in my inventory AKA the item at index 0.
HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
If the item is used up, then everything in my inventory will be shifted 1 index to the left (or in math terms (their current index - 1)).

What should happen, step-by-step blah blah blue key goes, then red, but use blue or whatever
Now that you know how Queues work, use what you've just learned to free me from my prison of brimstone and hellfire.
