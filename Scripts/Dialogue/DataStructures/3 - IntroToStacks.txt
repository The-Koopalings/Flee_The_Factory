Explain Stacks & how the inventory is red + has text as to what it is

CODE_BLOCK
You can see that the Pickup and UseItem code blocks are back to how they were in Level 1.

HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
Since we are in Stack mode, Pickup automatically places a picked-up item into the smallest, or leftmost, available index.
HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
If I try to pickup an item while my inventory is full, then I can't pick it up and nothing happens.

HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
UseItem, however, will try to use the biggest, or rightmost, occupied index. AKA the item that was last put into the inventory.
HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
This imitates the LIFO principle of Stacks, which is why we call this mode the Stack mode.

Now use what you have learned to get us out of this room!
