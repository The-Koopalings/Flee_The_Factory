Explain Stacks & how the inventory is red + has text as to what it is

CODE_BLOCK

HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
Since we are in Stack mode, Pickup automatically places a picked-up item into the smallest, or leftmost, available index.
HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
If I try to pickup an item while my inventory is full, then I can't pick it up and nothing happens.

HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
UseItem, however, will try to use the biggest, or rightmost, occupied index. AKA the item that was last put into the inventory.
HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
This imitates the LIFO principle of Stacks, which is why we call this mode the Stack mode.
