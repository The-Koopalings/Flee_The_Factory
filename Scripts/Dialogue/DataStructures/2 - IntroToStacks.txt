Hey partner look at our inventory.
As you can see it's still on "Stack" mode. You can tell that's the case by either the color of the inventory (red for stacks), or by the name of it at the top of the inventory.
Now let me explain what being in "Stack" mode means exactly.
As explained last time, the inventory modes make my inventory act like different types of data structures. A stack is a type of data structure.
Stacks work on the principle of "last in, first out", or LIFO, meaning if you wanted to take (or use) something out of a stack, then the last item put into the stack would be taken out (or used) first.
Now let me explain how this mode's Pickup and UseItem work.

CODE_BLOCK

HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
Since we are in Stack mode, Pickup automatically places a picked-up item into the smallest, or leftmost, available index.
HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
If I try to pickup an item while my inventory is full, then I can't pick it up and nothing happens.

HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
UseItem, however, will try to use the biggest, or rightmost, occupied index. AKA the item that was last put into the inventory.
HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
This imitates the LIFO principle of stacks, which is why we call this mode the Stack mode.

To get to the exit, we will have to keep in mind the stack concept of LIFO. Always remember that for stacks, the last item put in is the first to be used!
