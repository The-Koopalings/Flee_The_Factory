Hey partner look at our inventory.
As you can see it's still on [color=red]"Stack"[/color] mode. You can tell that's the case by either the color of the inventory ([color=red]red for stacks[/color]), or by the name of it at the top of the inventory.
Now let me explain what being in [color=red]"Stack"[/color] mode means exactly.
As explained last time, the inventory modes make my inventory act like different types of data structures. A stack is a type of data structure.
Stacks work on the principle of [color=yellow]"last in, first out"[/color], or [color=yellow]LIFO[/color], meaning if you wanted to take (or use) something out of a stack, then the last item put into the stack would be taken out (or used) first.
Now let me explain how this mode's [color=yellow]Pickup[/color] and [color=yellow]UseItem[/color] work.

HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
Since we are in [color=red]Stack[/color] mode, [color=yellow]Pickup[/color] automatically places a picked-up item into the [color=yellow]smallest, or leftmost,[/color] available index.
HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
If I try to pickup an item while my inventory is full, then I can't pick it up and nothing happens.

HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
[color=yellow]UseItem[/color], however, will try to use the [color=yellow]biggest, or rightmost,[/color] occupied index. AKA the item that was last put into the inventory.
HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
This imitates the [color=yellow]LIFO principle[/color] of stacks, which is why we call this mode the Stack mode.

To get to the exit, we will have to keep in mind the [color=yellow]stack concept of LIFO[/color]. Always remember that for stacks, the [color=yellow]last[/color] item put in is the [color=yellow]first[/color] to be used!
