You might have noticed that my inventory has changed modes.
Now it is in "Queue" mode, which is indicated by it being green and having the words "Queue" above it.
In this mode, my inventory acts like a queue data structure. Let me explain more about queues.
Queues are a type of data structure that works on the principle of "first in first out", or FIFO.
Meaning, the first item (or earliest item) that was put into a queue will be the first that is taken out (or used). Queues are kind of like the opposite of stacks in that way.

Now, let's go over how Pickup and UseItem work for Queue mode.

HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
Pickup in Queue mode works exactly the same as in Stack mode. 
HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
Pickup automatically places a picked-up item into the smallest, or leftmost, available index & if my inventory is full then I can't pickup the item.

HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
UseItem works differently in Queue mode because it follows the FIFO principle of queues.
HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
UseItem will try to use the earliest picked up item in my inventory AKA the item at index 0.
HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
If the item is used up, then everything in my inventory will be shifted 1 index to the left (or in math terms (their current index - 1)). So the item at index 1 will now be in index 0, the item at index 2 will be in index 1, and so on so forth.

To get to the exit, we will have to keep in mind the queue concept of FIFO. Always remember that for queues, the first item put in is the first to be used!
