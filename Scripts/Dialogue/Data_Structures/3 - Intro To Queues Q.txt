You might have noticed that my inventory has changed modes.
Now it is in [color=green]"Queue"[/color] mode, which is indicated by it being green and having the words "Queue" above it.
In this mode, my inventory acts like a queue data structure. Let me explain more about queues.
Queues are a type of data structure that works on the principle of [color=yellow]"first in first out"[/color], or FIFO.
Meaning, the first item (or earliest item) that was put into a queue will be the first that is taken out (or used). Queues are kind of like the [color=yellow]opposite[/color] of stacks in that way.

Now, let's go over how [color=yellow]Pickup[/color] and [color=yellow]UseItem[/color] work for Queue mode.

HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
Pickup in Queue mode works exactly the same as in Stack mode. 
HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
Pickup automatically places a picked-up item into the [color=yellow]smallest, or leftmost,[/color] available index & if my inventory is full then I can't pickup the item.

HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
UseItem works differently in Queue mode because it follows the [color=yellow]FIFO[/color] principle of queues.
HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
UseItem will try to use the [color=yellow]earliest[/color] picked up item in my inventory AKA the item at [color=yellow]index 0.[/color]
HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
If the item is used up, then everything in my inventory will be [color=yellow]shifted 1 index to the left[/color] (or in math terms (their current index - 1)). So the item at index 1 will now be in index 0, the item at index 2 will be in index 1, and so on so forth.

To get to the exit, we will have to keep in mind the [color=yellow]queue concept of FIFO.[/color] Always remember that for queues, the [color=yellow]first[/color] item put in is the [color=yellow]first[/color] to be used!
