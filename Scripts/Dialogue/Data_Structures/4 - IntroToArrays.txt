Oh look, my inventory has changed modes once again! This time it's in [color=blue]"Array"[/color] mode.
You can tell when my inventory is in Array mode because it will always be blue and have the words "Array" above it.
In this mode, my inventory will act like an array data structure.
Arrays are a type of data structure that allows you to [color=yellow]choose which index[/color] you want to put an item into or take an item out of.
So unlike stacks and queues, arrays allow you the freedom of choice. But if you put an item into an index that already has an item, the array will [color=yellow]overwrite[/color] (AKA delete) the previously stored item, replacing it with the new one.
So with arrays you have to be careful about where you choose to place items, a worry that wasn't there with stacks or queues.

CODE_BLOCK
You may have noticed that the [color=yellow]Pickup[/color] and [color=yellow]UseItem[/color] code blocks are slightly different in this mode.

HIGHLIGHT_PICKUP
In Array mode, you are able to [color=yellow]choose[/color] which index an item is put into with the Pickup code block.

HIGHLIGHT_USEITEM
As well as which index's item to use with the UseItem code block.

The ability to choose which index to put an item into or which index's item to use imitates how an array data structure would work.

Keep in mind that when choosing which index to put an item into, you could accidentally discard a previously stored item.
For example, if there is a [color=red]red Key[/color] in index 0 and you pickup a [color=green]green Key[/color] & put it into index 0, then the [color=red]red Key[/color] will be discarded. If you UseItem on index 0, then the [color=green]green Key[/color] will be used, but the [color=red]red Key[/color] is forever lost (until Restart).
Again, this imitates how a real array would work.

To move to the next room, remember to be careful about which [color=yellow]index[/color] you put your items into. If you put one in the same index as another then you might accidentally discard a key you need.
Also, be mindful and keep track of which key you put into which index. Make sure you don't accidentally use the wrong key on a door!
Now get us out of here!
