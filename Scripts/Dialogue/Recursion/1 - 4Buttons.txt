Calling is a cool thing to do. Main can call F1, F1 can call F2, and I can call ur mom.
But did you know that functions can also call themselves?
With this new concept, I can introduce you to the wonderful world of Recursion!

CODE_BLOCK
To start, let's walk me down 2 tiles, interact with the button, and rotate to the left. Please place the appropriate code blocks into Function 1.

Awesome! Explain recursion.
Let's place a F1 code block into Function 1. This means that Function 1 will now call itself repeatedly until the base case is fulfilled (the level is completed).

Finally, let's have Main call Function 1.

Now press run and watch me move it, move it!

Wahoo! ur mom is a lovely lady.
