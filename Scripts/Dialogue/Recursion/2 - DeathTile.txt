Oh no! What is this I spot ahead? Is that... a virus!?

CODE_BLOCK
Explain virus
If I am on top of a virus tile, make sure I don't interact with it! Otherwise my systems will get corrupted and I'll shut down.

Hmmm... I'm thinking right now. What if we use an if statement to help us...
If I am standing on top of a virus tile, move me forward. Otherwise, have me interact with a button tile.
You feel me right now? And remember, we can use recursion to beat this!
Good luck and please don't kill me...

Oh thank god I'm alive, I really thought you were gonna kill me! Oops, I mean hooray! I knew you could do it!
