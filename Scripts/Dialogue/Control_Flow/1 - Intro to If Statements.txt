Hmmm... I think this floor warrants a new concept. Have you ever heard of control flow?
Explain more about control flow.

IDE
Explain If-Else block.

CODE_BLOCK
Explain if code block.

Do you see the pattern we have here on this floor? My little brain is braining right now and I have an idea.
First let's place two forward code blocks into F1.
;

Now let's set the condition of the If statement to front == blocked. Click the text for each different variable to open up a drop down menu and select the correct option.
;

Now, if Robby is facing the wall, he should rotate to face the vertical path. Otherwise, he should press the button. Let's place a rotate right code block into the If statement.
;

Let's also place an interact code block into the Else statement.
;

Finally, let's call the if statement in F1.
;

Can you see what's going on here? The first time we call F1 in main, Robby will walk forwards 2 tiles and face the wall. Since the if condition is fulfilled, he will rotate right.
The next time we call F1, Robby will walk fowards 2 tiles again. However, the if condition will not be satisfied this time so the Else statement will execute instead.
Place 2 F1 code blocks into Main and press run when you're ready!

I never control my flow when I see ur mom.
