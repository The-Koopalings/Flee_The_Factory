FOREEEEEEEEEEEE!
Haha just kidding, we're not playing golf right now! The only thing I play with is ur mom's coochie.

IDE
Now let's learn about for loops. These work very differently from while loops!
Click the Loop text and select the for loop option.

Explain for loop.

CODE_BLOCK
First let's place 2 forward code blocks and 1 interact code block into the for loop.
;

Now let's set the conditions for the for loop counter. 
See how there's 4 buttons ahead of me? I want to repeat the code blocks in the loop 4 times.
First let's keep the start counter at 0. It is standard practice to start at 0 instead of 1 due to the way indexes work in Arrays. However, this is a topic we will learn later because you are still too stupid right now. For now, just remember to start at 0.
Next, let's set stop to 4 and the step counter to +1.
;

We chose these numbers so that the loop will execute 4 times. It is important to note that i will increase from 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3, but will stop before reaching 4.

Finally, let's call the for loop in Main.

Press run to see me go, go, go!

HOORIZZY! You have now learned the basics of control flow. As a fun challenge, try replaying this level using a while loop instead!
