FORE! Haha just kidding, we're not playing golf right now!

IDE
Anyways, let's learn about [color=yellow]for loops[/color]. 
Click on [color=yellow]Loop1[/color] and change it into a [color=yellow]For[/color] loop.
;

Just like [color=yellow]While[/color] loops, [color=yellow]For[/color] loops will continue looping as long as the condition is true.
The difference is how the [color=purple]condition[/color] works in [color=yellow]For[/color] Loops.
[color=yellow]For loops[/color] are sometimes thought of as [color=yellow]counting[/color] loops because they will run for a specific number of times and count its progress the whole way.
Do you see the [color=yellow]i[/color] in the [color=yellow]for loop[/color]? That's the counter!
In the [color=purple]condition[/color] we can specify what value [color=yellow]i[/color] [color=green]starts[/color] at, what value [color=yellow]i[/color] [color=red]stops[/color] at, and how much [color=yellow]i[/color] changes each [color=blue]step[/color] (or each iteration of the loop).

Lets try setting the [color=purple]conditions[/color] of the [color=yellow]for loop.[/color]                                                                                                                 Hmmm... but first I need to know [color=purple]how many times[/color] the [color=yellow]for[/color] loop is going to run
I know! See how there's [color=yellow]4 buttons[/color] ahead of me? I should have the loop run [color=yellow]4 times[/color] then, once for each button!
First let's keep the [color=green]start[/color] at [color=yellow]0[/color]. It is [wave amp=50.0 freq=5.0 connected=1][color=yellow]standard practice[/color][/wave] to start counting from 0 because of how numbers work inside of computers. 
In later puzzles you can use whatever number you want to, just make sure you do your math correctly!
Next, let's set [color=red]stop[/color] to [color=yellow]4[/color] and the [color=blue]step[/color] to [color=yellow]+1[/color]                                                                                                                         You can change the number values by either clicking the boxes they are in and typing the number, or by using the arrows next to each box.
;
For later rooms, you can also click on the [color=yellow]+[/color](addition) to change it to [color=yellow]*[/color] (multiply) , [color=yellow]/[/color] (divide), or [color=yellow]-[/color] (subtract).


CODE_BLOCK
Now let's place 2 [color=yellow]Forward[/color] code blocks and 1 [color=yellow]Interact[/color] code block into the [color=yellow]For loop[/color].
;

Finally, let's [color=yellow]call the for loop in Main[/color].
;

Press [color=yellow]Run[/color] to see me go, go, go!                                                                     Watch [color=yellow]i[/color] carefully as I run the code.                                                                The loop should [color=green]run[/color] when [color=yellow]i[/color] is equal to [color=green]0[/color], [color=green]1[/color], [color=green]2[/color], and [color=green]3[/color].                                      But it will [color=red]stop[/color] once [color=yellow]i[/color] is [color=red]4[/color].

HOORAH! You have now learned the basics of control flow. As a fun challenge, try replaying this level using a [color=yellow]while loop[/color] instead!
