Remember: You can set the conditions for If statements and While loops. 
When conditions are true, If statements execute the code underneath If, when false it'll execute code under Else.
When conditions are true for While loops, it will execute the code in it until the conditions are false.
You can set how many times a For loop will execute by setting what i should start at, what number i should stop at, and how much i increases with each loop.
