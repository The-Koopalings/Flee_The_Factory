Some levels will require you to code more than 1 function.
Using my X-ray vision, I can see that there's 2 different patterns on this floor. We'll have to program 2 different functions to deal with these.

CODE_BLOCK
Let's program [color=yellow]Func1[/color] to walk me [color=yellow]forward 3 tiles[/color] and [color=yellow]press the first button[/color].

Huzzah! Now let's program [color=yellow]Func2[/color] to [color=yellow]walk me down 2 tiles and rotate me when needed[/color]. (Hint: I shouldn't be facing the wall at the end of this function.)

Now let's see if you can call the functions in the right order in Main to walk me to the door. Press Run when you're ready!

Wow! That was a lot of fun(ctions)!
