Hey pal, do you remember how we talked about Main having a [color=yellow]limit[/color] on the [color=yellow]amount of code blocks[/color] you can put into it?
Well, that can be a problem for us since sometimes, that means we can't exit the room by [color=yellow]only[/color] putting code blocks into Main.
Luckily, we can work around that by relying on other sections of the IDE.

IDE
HIGHLIGHT_FUNCTION_BLOCK
As you can see here in the IDE, there is another section other than Main.
HIGHLIGHT_FUNCTION_BLOCK
We call these [color=yellow]functions[/color]. This specific function's name is [color=yellow]Func1[/color] or [color=yellow]F1[/color] for short. [color=yellow]Main[/color] is also a function, but a [color=yellow]special type of function[/color].
Regular [color=yellow]functions[/color] work very similarly to Main except, the code in it will [color=red]NOT[/color] run automatically when the [color=yellow]Run button[/color] is pressed.
Another difference between Main and a regular function is that [color=yellow]functions[/color] can be [color=yellow]"called"[/color], or used, by other IDE sections.
This means that Main, for example, can [color=yellow]call[/color] F1, which will [color=yellow]execute the code blocks[/color] in [color=yellow]F1[/color]. 
In a way, calling a function is similar to calling for help from a friend. 
If we use F1's help in Main (AKA we call F1 in Main), then we can open the door!
Keep in mind though that [color=yellow]functions also have a code block limit[/color].

CODE_BLOCK
Now, how exactly are you supposed to call F1?

HIGHLIGHT_CALL_F1
Well, here is a code block that we'll call [color=yellow]CALL_F1[/color]. If you put this into another IDE section, then it will [color=yellow]call and execute the code blocks in F1[/color].

Now, let's write a [color=yellow]function[/color] that will make me move [color=yellow]two tiles forward and interact[/color] with the button. Please place the appropriate code blocks into the IDE's function block.
;

Yay! Now, place the [color=yellow]CALL_F1[/color] code block into [color=yellow]Main[/color].
;

Something to note about [color=yellow]functions[/color] is that they are [color=yellow]reuseable[/color]. So, you can call a function multiple times.
This is especially [color=yellow]useful[/color] if you need me to move in a [color=yellow]pattern[/color].

Place [color=yellow]another CALL_F1[/color] code block into [color=yellow]Main[/color].
;

Press [color=yellow]Run[/color].

Congrats! I bet you're always the coolest at a function.
